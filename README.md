What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a specific subfield of machine learning: a new take on learning representations from data that puts an emphasis on learning successive layers of increasingly meaningful representations.
The “deep” in “deep learning” isn’t a reference to any kind of deeper understanding achieved by the approach; 
rather, it stands for this idea of successive layers of representations. 
How many layers contribute to a model of the data is called the depth of the model. 
Other appropriate names for the field could have been layered representations learning or hierarchical representations learning.
Modern deep learning often involves tens or even hundreds of successive layers of representations, and they’re all learned automatically from exposure to training data. 
Meanwhile, other approaches to machine learning tend to focus on learning only one or two layers of representations of the data hence, they’re sometimes called shallow learning.
 In deep learning, these layered representations are learned via models called neural networks, structured in literal layers stacked on top of each other.

Understanding how deep learning works:
1.) A neural network is parametrized by its weight.

2.) A loss function measures the quality of network's output

3.) The loss score is used as signal to adjust weights
